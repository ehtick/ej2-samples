        This sample demonstrates how to build a UML sequence diagram using the diagram's <code>model</code> property. The <code>UmlSequenceDiagramModel</code> type provides a structured approach to defining key elements such as participants, messages, activation boxes, and interaction fragments. This approach enables the clear visualization of sequential interactions within complex systems, such as secure transaction workflows.
