    <p>This example demonstrates the virtualization support of the ComboBox. The component has 150 items bound to it; however, when you open the suggestion list, only few items are loaded based on the popup height, and the remaining items are loaded while scrolling.</p>

<div id="description">
    <p>The <code>ComboBox</code> component supports virtualization, which improves UI performance for large amounts of data. To enable virtualization, set the <code>enableVirtualization</code> property to true. When virtualization is enabled, ComboBox doesn't render the entire suggestion data source on initial component rendering. It loads the N number of items in the popup on initial rendering and the remaining set number of items will load while scrolling.
        Virtualization works with both local and remote data.</p>
    <p>To perform the virtualization feature in ComboBox, the <code>VirtualSCroll</code> module
        have to be injected in the application end.</p>
