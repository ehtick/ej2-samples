    <p>
        chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use Funnel series, we need to inject
        <code>FunnelSeries</code> module using <code>AccumulationChart.Inject(FunnelSeries)</code> method.

        More information on the funnel series can be found in this
